Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my journey as an aspiring software developer and includes projects I’ve built as part of my learning experience during my Umschulung (retraining) to become a Fachinformatiker für Anwendungsentwicklung. It also highlights my key skills, experience, and how to contact me for potential opportunities.
